    "Strava API: Leverage the Strava API to access a vast pool of public running data. This includes information on distance, pace, elevation, heart rate, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Repositories: Look for public datasets on platforms like GitHub, Kaggle, or other data sharing platforms. These repositories may contain anonymized runner data that can be used for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitness Apps: Consider reaching out to popular fitness apps for access to anonymized or aggregated user data. Some apps might have APIs or data-sharing programs for research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Generated Content: Explore forums, communities, and social media platforms where runners share their training experiences. Web scraping or utilizing APIs may be necessary to collect this data.\n",
