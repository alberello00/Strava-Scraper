Runner Data Analysis and Generative AI Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze data from runners' training sessions and develop a generative AI model fine-tuned on this data. The resulting model can generate personalized training plans for individual runners based on their historical training data.

Usage
Describe how to use your project. Provide examples and usage scenarios.

bash
Copy code
python analyze_runner_data.py --input_data data/runners_data.csv --output_results results/
Data Collection
Explain how the data was collected, including any sources or APIs used. Provide instructions for users to collect their own data if applicable.

Data Preprocessing
Detail the steps taken to preprocess the runner data before using it for training the generative model. This may include cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

Training the Generative Model
Explain the process of training the generative model on the preprocessed data. Provide information on the architecture of the model, hyperparameters used, and any specific techniques applied.

bash
Copy code
python train_generative_model.py --input_data preprocessed_data/ --output_model models/
Generating Personalized Training Plans
Demonstrate how to use the trained generative model to create personalized training plans for individual runners. Include any input parameters or configurations required.

bash
Copy code
python generate_training_plan.py --runner_id 123 --model_path models/model.h5 --output_plan plans/
Evaluation
Explain how the performance of the generative model can be evaluated. This may include metrics used, benchmarking against existing models, or user feedback.

Contributing
Provide guidelines for others who may want to contribute to the project. Include information on how to submit bug reports, suggest improvements, and propose new features.
